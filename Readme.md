# 100 Days of Machine Learning

This repository documents my 100 days of machine learning challenge. The challenge involves studying and practicing machine learning concepts, techniques, and tools for at least an hour every day for 100 consecutive days.

## Goals

The goals of this challenge are:

- To gain a deeper understanding of machine learning concepts and techniques.
- To gain practical experience in implementing and deploying machine learning models.
- To build a portfolio of machine learning projects that demonstrate my skills and knowledge.






## Topics Covered

Over the course of this challenge, I will cover a range of topics in machine learning, including:

- Python programming
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Data visualization
- Regression and classification models
- Gradient Descent
- Curse Dimensionality.
- Regularization
- Model evaluation and selection
- Model deployment and serving

## Progress Updates

I will update my progress in this challenge on a weekly basis, detailing the topics covered and the projects worked on during that week.
